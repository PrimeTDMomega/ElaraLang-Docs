# About Elara Programming Language

Elara is an exciting programming language designed for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that combines functional programming paradigms with a familiar and expressive syntax. Drawing inspiration from languages like Haskell and F#, Elara aims to provide a powerful and developer-friendly environment for JVM-based applications.

## Key Features

### Expressive Syntax

Elara's syntax has been crafted with inspiration from Haskell and F#, resulting in a coding style that is both expressive and concise. This makes it easier for developers familiar with these languages to transition to Elara and start writing clean and elegant code.

### Hindley-Milner Type System

At the core of Elara's reliability is its Hindley-Milner type system. This system not only ensures that your code is type-safe, but it also offers type inference capabilities that catch errors early during compilation. This leads to more robust and maintainable code.

### Functional Purity Enforcement

Elara enforces the concept of functional purity, encouraging developers to write functions that are devoid of side effects. This helps reduce bugs, makes code easier to test, and enhances overall code quality.

### Interoperability with Java

Elara seamlessly integrates with Java code, providing developers with the flexibility to leverage existing Java libraries and resources. This interoperability ensures that you can combine the power of both languages within your projects.

## Project Status

As of now, Elara is a work in progress and is not yet suitable for production use. Our team is actively working on its development, refining features, and addressing issues to bring it to a stable state.
